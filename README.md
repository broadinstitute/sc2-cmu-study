Files beginning with 'epi' document analyses of epidemiological and demographic parameters of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

The 'overdisp' script calculates the overdispersion parameter associated with genomic clusters and social contacts.

The 'wastewater_analyses_etc' jupyter notebook contains code necessary to generate all wastewater analyses and relevant figures. In addition, it contains a few contact-tracing analyses, clinical sequencing analyses, and the intra-host allele analysis for B.1.429.1.
