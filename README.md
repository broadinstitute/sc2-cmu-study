Scripts associated with the study "Multimodal surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 at a university enables development of a robust outbreak response framework," available at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.06.22277314v2.

Files beginning with 'epi' document analyses of epidemiological and demographic parameters of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

The 'overdisp' script calculates the overdispersion parameter associated with genomic clusters and social contacts.

The 'transmission-reconstruction' script uses Outbreaker2 (Campbell et al. 2018, BMC Bioinformatics) to reconstruct the outbreak using combinations of genomic, contact tracing, and WiFi proximity data.

The 'wastewater_analyses_etc' Jupyter Notebook contains code associated with all wastewater analyses and figures. In addition, it contains some contact tracing, clinical sequencing, and B.1.429.1 minor allele analyses.
