Scripts associated with the study "Multimodal surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 at a university enables development of a robust outbreak response framework," available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2022.09.003.

Files beginning with 'epi' document analyses of epidemiological and demographic parameters of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

The 'overdisp' script calculates the overdispersion parameter associated with genomic clusters and social contacts.

The 'transmission-reconstruction' script uses Outbreaker2 (Campbell et al. 2018, BMC Bioinformatics) to reconstruct the outbreak using combinations of genomic, contact tracing, and WiFi proximity data.

The 'wastewater_analyses_etc' Jupyter Notebook contains code associated with all wastewater analyses and figures. In addition, it contains some contact tracing, clinical sequencing, and B.1.429.1 minor allele analyses.

The 'wifi_script_final' Jupyter Notebook contains all code associated with wifi proximity network analyses and figures. It also includes some contact tracing network analyses used for assessing the outbreaker2 results.
